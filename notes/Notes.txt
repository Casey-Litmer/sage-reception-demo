- Using React@19 and vite@latest for this demo

- Can't get tailwind to import rules in index.css (breaking change?)
    - Attempting to add
        ```
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
        ```
        gives warning: "Unknown at rule @tailwind"

    - Tailwind is now working.  You must expand all of the extensions in 'content'
        rather than doing '.{ts,tsx,...}'

        But the warning still persists... fuck it
