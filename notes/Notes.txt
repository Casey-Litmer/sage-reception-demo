//Issues

- Using React@19 and vite@latest for this demo

X- Can't get tailwind to import rules in index.css (breaking change?)
    - Attempting to add
        ```
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
        ```
        gives warning: "Unknown at rule @tailwind"

    - Tailwind is now working.  You must expand all of the extensions in 'content'
        rather than doing '.{ts,tsx,...}'

        But the warning still persists... fuck it

    - What works: disabling CSS validate in vscode (ctrl+,)


X- For some reason, the new vite project added margins to #root, which cannot be overwritten
    in index.css.  Not sure where the default #root is that the body div is pulling from

    - What I tried: 
        - Moving index.css outside of src
        - defining #root
        - Adding this to index.css overrides ALL margins/paddings
            ```
            * {
            margin: 0px !important;
            padding: 0px !important;
            }
            ```
    - What works:
        - The secret #root is in Home.css
            This is stupid and should not be the default >:(

- The calendar component has a hard time using % height. 
  It pushes everything around so I have to set it to a fixed
  height of 400px.  This of course doesn't scale with the window.
  It might be one of those things that you have to calculate the height manually.


X- Tailwind overrides h1,h2,h3,... styles by default
  Must include this to make it normal:
  ```
    @layer base {
    h1 {
        font-size: 3.2em !important;
        line-height: 1.1 !important;
    }
    h2 {
        font-size: 2.5em !important;
    }
    h3 {
        font-size: 2em !important;
    }
    }
  ```

X- w-full textSections keep overflowing the page when there are multiple of them
  I am pretty sure this version of tailwindcss has some serious bugs with that.
  I have tried everything to no avail.
  - What works:
    set overflow-x: hidden in body


- Can't get flowbite <Button> to apply text size


//================================================================  
//Todo

- look into .env handling (will be important in actual production)
    - .env : loaded in all cases
    - .env.local : loaded in all cases, ignored by git
    - .env.[mode] : loaded in specific mode
    - .env.[mode].local : loaded in specific mode, ignored by git
